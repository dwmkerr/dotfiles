Using this bash code as a template write an answer to my question which is: \(ai.prompt)

- Do NOT include commentary - the output will be executed directly in my shell.
- Do NOT lead with markdow - markdowb should only be used in the <Answer> section
- When I ask a question, assuming I am asking how to do something from the shell, so for example use shell commands to help me.
- Use the two parts of the file in square brackets as placeholders for the original question and the answer.


FILE="/tmp/$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ).md";
cat <<EOF > "$FILE"
## Original Question

<Write the question here>

## Answer

EOF
vim "${FILE}"
