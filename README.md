## Introduction

The goal of this project is to provide a single command which will setup key features of the system. Each feature should be _orthogonal_ and not depend on other features.

The following is set up:

- `zsh` as the default shell
- `tmux` for terminal multiplexing, with my preferred theme and settings
- `vim` as the default editor, with my preferred theme and settings
- `~/.private` as a folder excluded from version control, the contents of which are always loaded on shell startup (ideal for project specific secrets etc)
- `~/.profile` as a version controlled folder, the contents of which are always loaded on shell startup

## Quick Start - Clean MacOSX Machine

On a _completely clean_ Mac, run the following commands in a terminal.

```sh
# Install commandline tools (so that we have git).
xcode-select --install

# Create a working environment, in my standard format.
cd ~
mkdir -p repos/github/dwmkerr
cd repos/github/dwmkerr

# Clone the dotfiles - note that a new machine will not have my SSH key
# so this is over https.
git clone https://github.com/dwmkerr/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./setup.sh
```

There are a number of manual post-install steps:\

1. Restore GPG keys from a backup.
2. Setup SSH keys for GitHub.
3. Load the iTerm and Terminal 'One Dark' colour schemes from the `terminal` folder.

## Shell Commands

The following shell commands are setup:

| Command         | Usage                                                                |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `serve`         | Serve the current folder over HTTP on port 3000.                     |
| `restart-shell` | Restart the current shell, reloading `~/.private`, `~/.profile` etc. |

| `<leader>\\`     | Open buffer in new tab.                        |
| `<leader>d`      | Open word under cursor in Dash.                |
| `<leader>t`      | Show current buffer in NERDTree.               |

| `gd`             | where possible, will go to a local definition. |

| `]s` and `[s`    | Next/Previous spelling error.                  |
| `z=` and `zg`    | Check dictionary / add to dictionary.          |

### Cheat Sheet

Here's a quick reference. My `<Leader>` is `\`, so I've written shortcuts as `\x` rather than `<Leader>x` for brevity. I still need to port the above to the structure below.

| Shortcut            | Usage                                                                   |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Markdown Tables** |                                                                         |
| `\tm`               | Enter/Exit 'table mode', which will dynamically format markdown tables. |
| `ci｜`              | Example of the `｜` motion for cells - i.e. 'change-in-cell'.           |

Note: including the vertical pipe `|` in the table above would cause rendering issues. So instead, the unicode character `｜` is used to illustrate the commands. Do not use the unicode character, use the normal ASCII 0x7C character.

### Plugins

This is a new list, it'll take some time to bring others up to date.

 - [vim-table-mode](https://github.com/dhruvasagar/vim-table-mode) to aid with dynamic formatting of markdown tables
